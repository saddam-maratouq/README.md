- Less effort and skill required by staff.
- Less machinery and equipment needed.
- Good quality.
- Saves money from all aspects.
- High-quality consistency.
- Increased reliability with the reuse of the existing components.

## Views of a Component:

A component can have three different views âˆ’ object-oriented view, conventional view, and process-related view.

## Characteristics of Components:

- Reusability.
- Replaceable.
- Not context specific.

- Independent.

A component-level design can be represented by using some intermediary representation (e.g. graphical, tabular, or text-based) that can be translated into source code.

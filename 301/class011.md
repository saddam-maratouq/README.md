# OAuth

**1/ What is OAuth?**

- it is an authentication protocol that allows you to approve one application interacting with another on your behalf without giving away your password.

**2/ Give an example of what using OAuth would look like.**

- The simplest example of OAuth is when you go to log onto a website and it offers one or more opportunities to log on using another website’s/service’s log on.

**3/ How does OAuth work? What are the steps that it takes to authenticate the user?**

- The first website connects to the second website on behalf of the user, using OAuth, providing the user’s verified identity.

- The second site generates a one-time token and a one-time secret unique to the transaction and parties involved.

- The first site gives this token and secret to the initiating user’s client software.

- The client’s software presents the request token and secret to their authorization provider (which may or may not be the second site).

- If not already authenticated to the authorization provider, the client may be asked to authenticate. After authentication, the client is asked to approve the authorization transaction to the second website.

- The user approves (or their software silently approves) a particular transaction type at the first website.

- The user is given an approved access token (notice it’s no longer a request token).

- The user gives the approved access token to the first website.

- The first website gives the access token to the second website as proof of authentication on behalf of the user.

- The second website lets the first website access their site on behalf of the user.

- The user sees a successfully completed transaction occurring

**4/ What is OpenID?**

- OpenID is about authentication, OpenID is for humans logging into machines.

# Authorization and Authentication flows

**1/ What is the difference between authorization and authentication?**

- authentication is the process of verifying who a user is, while authorization is the process of verifying what they have access to

**2/ What is Authorization Code Flow?**

- exchanges an Authorization Code for a token

**3/ What is Authorization Code Flow with Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE)?**

- The PKCE-enhanced Authorization Code Flow introduces a secret created by the calling application that can be verified by the authorization server; this secret is called the Code Verifier.

**4/ What is Implicit Flow with Form Post?**

- It does offer a streamlined workflow if the application needs only an ID token to perform user authentication.

**5/ What is Client Credentials Flow?**

- the system authenticates and authorizes the app rather than a user

**6/ What is Device Authorization Flow?**

- rather than authenticate the user directly, the device asks the user to go to a link on their computer or smartphone and authorize the device

**7/ What is Resource Owner Password Flow?**

- requests that users provide credentials (username and password), typically using an interactive form.

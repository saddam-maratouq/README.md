# FUNCTIONAL PROGRAMMING :

**1- What is functional programming?**

- is a programming model where you mostly construct and structure your code using functions.

**2- What is a pure function and how do we know if something is a pure function?**

- functions that accept an input and returns a value without modifying any data outside its scope.

## **3- What are the benefits of a pure function?**

- It does not cause any observable side effects

## **4- What is immutability?**

- its state cannot change after it’s created. If you want to change an immutable object, you can’t. Instead, you create a new object with the new value.

## **5- What is Referential transparency?**

- it can be replaced with its corresponding value (and vice-versa) without changing the program's behavior.

## **6- What is a module?**

- it is responsible for make the functions re-useable

## **7- What does the word ‘require’ do?**

- The require() method is used to load and cache JavaScript modules.

## **8- How do we bring another module into the file the we are working in?**

- by using the static import statement.
  **9- What do we have to do to make a module available?**
- module.exports = function name.

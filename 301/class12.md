# Mongo and Mongoose

## SQL vs NoSQL

| **SQL**                        | **NoSQL**                                                                      |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Relational Databases (RDBMS)   | non-relational or distributed database                                         |
| table based databases          | collection of key-value pair, documents, graph databases or wide-column stores |
| have predefined schema         | dynamic schema for unstructured data                                           |
| vertically scalable            | horizontally scalable                                                          |
| uses structured query language | Unstructured Query Language                                                    |

1. **What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?**

- complex queries.

2. **Give a real world example.**

- MySql, Oracle, Sqlite, Postgres and MS-SQL.

3. **What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?**

- For the type of data to be stored.

4. **Give a real world example.**

- MongoDB, BigTable, Redis, RavenDb, Cassandra, Hbase, Neo4j and CouchDb.

5. **Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?**

- NoSQL database.

6. **Which type of database is best for scalability?**

- NoSQL databases.

7. **What does SQL stand for?**

- Structured Query Language.

8. **What is a relational database?**

- Database which works with certain assumptions or in a certain way and it supports SQL .

9. **What type of structure does a relational database work with?**

- SQL structure, tables.

10. **What is a ‘schema’?**

- Collection of database objects linked with a particular database username. The username that I am talking about is called the Schema owner, or more appropriately the owner of the related group of objects.

11. **What is a NoSQL database?**

- Unstructured

12. **How does it work?**

- use collections instead of tables , collections have documents (can use different  structures / no schema applied).

13. **What is inside of a Mongo database?**

- collections, documents , many different data that are not applied to schema or relations.

14. **Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why.**

- MongoDB is more flexible, because you store your data where ever you want, you don't have to follow a schema,(have less relations merging and super fast and efficient query ).

15. **What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?**

- Having duplicated data.

# Basics of HTML, CSS & JS


HTML elements are used to describe the structure of the page (e.g. headings, subheadings, paragraphs).

**Headings:**

HTML has six "levels" of headings.
The contents of an < h1> element is the largest, and the contents of an < h6> element is the smallest.

**Paragraphs :**

To create a paragraph use the opening < p> tag and closing < /p> tag.

**Bold and italic :**
By enclosing words in the tags < b> and < /b> we can make characters appear bold.

By enclosing words in the tags < i> and < /i> we can make characters appear italic.


**Superscript & subscript :**

The < sup> element is used with suffixes of dates or mathematical concepts like raising a number to a power.

The < sub> element is commonly used with foot notes or chemical formulas.

**semantic markup:**

text elements that are not intended to affect the structure of your web pages, but they do add extra information to the pages.

< strong>  indicates that its content has strong importance.

< blockquote> used for longer quotes that take up an entire paragraph.

< q> used for shorter quotes.

< cite> used when you are referencing a piece of work< address> to contain contact details for the author of the page.

< address> to contain contact details for the author of the page.

**Introducing CSS :**

CSS declarations sit inside curly brackets and each is made up of two parts: a property and a value, separated by a colon.


CSS works by associating rules with HTML elements that govern how the content should be displayed.

A CSS rule contains two parts: a selector and a declaration.

**CSS Selectors :**

* Universal selector:     * { } target all elements on the page. 
* Type selector.            	h1,h2,h3 { } , target the < h1>, < h2> and < h3> elements.
* ID selector.                  	#introduction { } Targets the element whose id attribute has a value of introduction.
* descendant Selector.	          p a { } Targets any < a> elements that sit inside a < p> element, even if there are other elements nested between them.
* child selector.	                 Targets any < a> elements that are children of an < li> element (but not other < a> elements in the page).

**Basic JavaScript instructions:**

A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow one-by-one.
Each individual instruction or step is known as a statement.
Statements should end with a semicolon.

**Comments :**

It can be used to explain JavaScript code.

It makes your code easier to read and understand.


**Variables:**

They are containers for storing data values.
In order to declare a variable , first you create it then you give it a name, then you assign a value.
Var is example pf what programmers called a keyword.


**Rules for naming variables :**

* Names must begin with a letter, dollar sign ($),or an underscore (_). It must not start with a number.
* Do not use a dash(-) or a period (.) in a variable name.
* Use a name that describes the kind of information that the variable stores.
* You cannot use keywords or reserved words.


**Aray**

The JavaScript Array class is a global object that is used in the construction of arrays; which are high-level, list-like objects.



**Operators:**

1- **Artihemtic Operators :**

2- **String Operator :**

 There is just one string operator: the+ symbol. It is used to join the strings on either side of it.

**Decisions and Loops”**

**There are two components to a decision :**

1- An expression is evaluated; which returns a value.

2-  A conditional statement says what to do in a given situation.


**Comparison Operators :**

values ITS "true" or "false".

* "= =" equal to
* "! =" no equal to.
* "= = =" strict equal to.
* ">" greater than.
* "<" less than.
* ">=" greater than or equal to.
* "<=" less than or equal to.

**Logical Operators :**

compare the results of more than one comparison operator.

"&&" logical and.

"||" logical or.

"!" logical not.


**if statment:**

It evaluates or check a condition. If it is "true", any statements in the subsquent code block are executed.


**if Else statment**

Use else if to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false

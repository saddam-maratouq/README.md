 # HTML Lists, CSS Boxes, JS Control Flow summary :

 **Lists:**

 There are three types of HTML lists: ordered, unordered, and definition.

 **Ordered**  >> lists use numbers.

 **Unordered lists** use bullets.

.............................................


**Definition lists** are used to define terminology.

< dt> is used to contain the definition term.

< dl> is used when we want to create a definition list. 

< dd> is used to contain the definition.

Lists can be nested inside one another. 

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

**Boxes :** 

**Box dimensions :** width , height.

**Limiting width :** min-width , max-width.

**Limiting height :** min-height , max-height.

.................................................

**Overflow content:**

When the content is larger than the box itself.

We use “overflow: hidden” to hide any extra content.

If you want the user to scroll to see the missing content use “overflow: scroll”.

**Every box has three variable properties:**

**border :** it separated the edge of one box from another.

**margin :** it is outside of the edge of the border.

**padding :** it is the space between the border of a box and any content within it.

..........................................

**White space :** the space between items on a page.

**Every box has three variable properties:**

-border : it separated the edge of one box from another.

-margin : it is outside of the edge of the border.

-padding : it is the space between the border of a box and any content within it.


**Centering:** 
*If you want centering a content use :* 

1-Left-margin : auto 

2-Right-margin : auto 

**Display :**

**display: inline** = Displays an element as an inline element (like < span>)

**display: block** = Displays an element as a block element (like < p>). It starts on a new line, and takes up the whole width.

**display: inline-block** = The element itself is formatted as an inline element, but you can apply height and width values.


*Visibility:*

**Visibility: hidden** = this hides the element.

**Visibility: visible** = it shows the element.

**Border images :**

allows you to specify an image to be used as the border around an element.

**Box-shadow :**

It allows you to add a drop shadow around a box. 

**It comes with these values :**

* horizontal offset
* Vertical offset.
* Blur distance.
* Spread of shadow

....................................

**if statment :** 

How does it work ? 

The IF statement works by checking the expression to see whether a condition is met and returns a value if true ended if false go to else statment . 

**Arrays :** 

A special type of variable. It doesn't just store one value; it stores a list of values.
You create it by giving it a var and the name of the array.
Values of arrays are accessed as if they are a numbered list.  

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

**switch statment** 

 How does it work ? 
 It starts with a variable called the switch value. Each case indicates a possible value for this variable and the code that should run if the variable matches that value.


 **Loops :**

 **For / while / Do while.** 

 It check a condition. If it returns true, a code block will run. Then the condition will be checked again and if it still returns true, the code block will run again. It repeats until the condition returns false.

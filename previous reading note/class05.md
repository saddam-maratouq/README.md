# HTML Images; CSS Color & Text

**Images :**
You can add images into your page by using < img> element, with the "src" that tells the browser where it can find the image file. Also add.
**"alt"** to give a text description of the image.

You can specify the size of the image by adding "height" and "width". attributes. and the place of the image by using "align" attribute, wether
you want it at left or right or top or middle or bottom.

 **three tips should be followed we creating images for your website:**

 * save images in the right format. [ It is better to be "JPEG for the colorful iamges"

* Save images at the right size. [ you can use "Adope photoshop" to have the image in correct shape]

* Use the correct resolution. [Images should be saved at a resoltution of 72 ppi. The higher the resolution, the larger the size of the file.

* for the images dimensions, it is better to save the image with the same width and height that you want them to appear on the page.

They are resolution- independent, they are created by placing points on a grid.

You can add captions to the images by using **< figure>** and **< figcaption>** element. .....................................................................................................................................

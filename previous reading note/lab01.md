 ## Growth Mindset 
 
**Individuals who believe their talents can be developed (through hard work, good strategies, and input from others) have a growth mindset. They tend to achieve more than those with a more fixed mindset (those who believe their talents are innate gifts). This is because they worry less about looking smart and they put more energy into learning. When entire companies embrace a growth mindset, their employees report feeling far more empowered and committed; they also receive far greater organizational support for collaboration and innovation. In contrast, people at primarily fixed-mindset companies report more of only one thing: cheating and deception among employees, presumably to gain an advantage in the talent race.** 

### there is 3 reminders to keep myrself in a growth mindset : 
   1. *Acknowledge and embrace imperfections.*
   
Hiding from your weaknesses means you’ll never overcome them.


2. *View challenges as opportunities.*

Having a growth mindset means relishing opportunities for self-improvement. Learn more about how to fail well

3. *Try different learning tactics.*

There’s no one-size-fits-all model for learning. What works for one person may not work for you. Learn about learning strategies.

# Introductory HTML and JavaScript

**Structure :**

*We use structure when we writing web pages.*

*The HTML code is made up of characters that live inside angled brackets — these are called HTML elements.*

*Elements are usually made up of two tags: an opening tag and a closing tag.*

***what is structure web page?***

***Site structure or website architecture refers to how your website is designed or how various pages on your website.*** 




**Tags :**

Tags are often referred to as elements. 

Opening tags can carry attributes, which tell us more about the content of that element.

Attributes require a name and a value. 

The page contains a “ head, title, body ”. 



**HTML :**

1-HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language.

2-To learn HTML you need to know what tags are available for you to use, what they do, and where they can go.


**Paragraphs in html**

HTML paragraphs are defined with the <p> tag:
  
  <p>This is test phargraph.</p> 
  
  
  **id attribute:**
  
  It is used to uniquely identify that element from other elements on the page.

It is important that no two elements on the same page have the same value for their id attributes.

The id attribute is known as a global attribute because it can be used on any element.


**Block elements:**

It always appear to start on a new line in the browser window.

Examples of block elements are
< h1>, < p>, < ul>, and < li>. 


**Inline elements:** 

It appear to continue on the same line as their neighbouring elements.

Examples of inline elements are

< a>, < b>, < em>, and < img>.


**Grouping text & elements in a block:**

**< div>**

The < div> element allows you to group a set of elements together in one block-level box.


**< iframe>**

An iframe is like a little window that has been cut into your page, and in that window you can see another page. The term iframe is an abbreviation of inline frame. 


**< meta> :**

The < meta> tag allows you to supply all kinds of information about your web page. It is not visible to users but fulfills a number of purposes such as telling search engines about your page. is an empty element so it does not have a closing tag. 




**Escape Characters:**

Escape characters are used to include special characters in your pages such as <, >, and € 



**HTML5 layouts:**

The new HTML5 elements indicate the purpose of different parts of a web page and help to describe its structure.

the < header> element used to contain the site name and the main navigation.

The < footer> element contains copyright information, along with links to the privacy policy and terms and conditions.



The < article> element acts as a container for any section of a page that could stand alone and potentially be syndicated.



The < aside> element has two purposes, depending on whether it is inside an < article> element or not. When the < aside> elements used inside an < article> element, it should contain information that is related to the article. When the < aside> element is used outside of an < article> element, it acts as a container for content that is related to the  entire page.


The < section> element groups related content together, and typically each section would have its own heading. it may contain several distinct < article> elements that have a common theme or purpose.



the < div> element will remain an important way to group together related elements, because you should not be using these new elements that you have just met for purposes other than those explicitly stated.

Older browsers that do not understand HTML5 elements need to be told which elements are block-level elements.



**Process & Design:**

**When you are creating a new website; three questions should be answered;**


1- Who is the site For?
2- Why people visit your page?
3- What your visitors are trying to achieve?
4- What information your visitors need?
5- How often people with visit your site? 




 1- Site Maps :
It allows you to plan the structure of a site. 


2- WireFrames:

It allows you to organize the information that will need to go on each page.


**Getting your message across using Design:**


Design is about communication. Visual hierarchy helps visitors understand what you are trying to tell them.

You can differentiate between pieces of information using size, color, and style.

You can use grouping and similarity to help simplify the information you present.

**The ABC of programming:**

**What is “script” and how do I create one ?**

Script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow to achieve a goal.

Each time the script runs, it might only use a subset of all the instructions.

Computers approach tasks in a different way than humans, so your instructions must let the computer solve the task prggrammatically.

To approach writing a script, break down your goal into a series of tasks and then work out each step needed to complete that task (a flowchart can help).



HOW HTML, CSS, & JAVASCRIPT FIT TOGETHER?

**HTML : content layer.
CSS : presentation layer.
JAVASCRIPT : behaviour layer.**



***These three layers form the basis of a popular approach to building web pages called progressive enhancement.***


**CREATING A BASIC JAVASCRIPT:**

JavaScript is written in plain text, just like HTML and CSS.

When you want to use JavaScript with a web page, you use the HTML < script> element to tell the browser it is coming across a script.

It is best to keep JavaScript code in its own JavaScript file. but they have the . j s extension.
